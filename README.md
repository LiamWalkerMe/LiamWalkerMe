# 💫 About Me:
My passions include computer science, UX/UI design, [photography](https://liamwalker.me/photography/), and [videography](https://liamwalker.me/videos/), [robotics](https://liamwalker.me/ftc-robotics/), technology, and coding. I love exploring the latest developments in these fields, from programming languages to hardware components, and I enjoy building my own gadgets and devices in my spare time. I also loves to capture moments and tell stories through my lens. I feature my “sets” of images on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/liamwalker.me/) account. Each set has a theme and a description and can be viewed on Instagram or [here](https://liamwalker.me/photography/) on my website! When I’m not taking photos, I like to make [videos](https://liamwalker.me/videos/) of my friends, using my skills in videography to create beautiful, cinematic, or funny videos. I find that my passion for photography and videography often intersects with my interest in technology, especially in education. The [Zora 2024](https://liamwalker.me/zora2024/) campaign and [Stove Solutions engineering project](https://liamwalker.me/stovesolutions/) some of my big [educational projects](https://liamwalker.me/educational/) where my love for computers, design, photography, and videography overlap.
