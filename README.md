# 💫 About Me:
My passions include computer science, UX/UI design, photography, and videography, robotics, technology, and coding. I love exploring the latest developments in these fields, from programming languages to hardware components, and I enjoy building my own gadgets and devices in my spare time. I also loves to capture moments and tell stories through my lens. I feature my “sets” of images on my Instagram account. Each set has a theme and a description and can be viewed on Instagram or here on my website! When I’m not taking photos, I like to make videos of my friends, using my skills in videography to create beautiful, cinematic, or funny videos. I find that my passion for photography and videography often intersects with my interest in technology, especially in education. The Zora 2024 campaign and Stove Solutions engineering project some of my big educational projects where my love for computers, design, photography, and videography overlap.
